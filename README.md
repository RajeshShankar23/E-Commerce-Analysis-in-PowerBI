# E-Commerce-Analysis-in-PowerBI
## Introduction
As a new analyst for the client, tasked with analyzing their ecommerce dataset and leveraging Power BI to create engaging dashboard-style pages, the primary goal of this project is to drive increased sales and customer satisfaction while simultaneously reducing operational costs for the online pet supply store.
## Analytical Approach
The client has two primary business goals. The first is to serve as many customers as possible and increase sales. The second is to reduce its operating expenses. For sales growth, you will focus on upsell and cross-sell opportunities. In a cross-sell, you promote a relevant product at the point of purchase. For shipping cost reductions, we can explore some of the following alternatives. Consolidating multiple shipments into a single one. Reducing package size dimensions and weight. And, finally, shipping a higher quantity of a product. Also we can implement market basket analysis. A market basket analysis aims to find products frequently bought together in a single checkout. One way this is can be achieved is by determining the correlation coefficient between purchased quantities.

# Final Recommendations:

1.	Regional Analysis:
•	California in the West region contributes significantly to shipping costs, indicating a high volume of shipments from this area. Targeting this region for upselling quantity promotions could yield significant results due to its substantial contribution to shipping costs.

2.	Average Shipping Costs by Region:
•	The West region has the highest average shipping cost. Implementing strategies to reduce shipping costs in this region, such as negotiating better rates with carriers or optimizing logistics routes, can lead to cost savings.

3.	Product Category Insights:
•	Pet Food has the highest average quantity, indicating strong demand for this category. Upselling promotions on related products or bundling offers with pet food items could capitalize on this demand.
•	Electronics, with the lowest average quantity, may benefit from targeted promotions aimed at increasing sales volume. Bundle offers, discounts on related accessories, or loyalty programs could incentivize customers to purchase more electronics items.

Promotional Strategies:
Implement quantity-based promotions such as "Buy One, Get One" deals, volume discounts, or bundle offers across all categories to encourage customers to purchase more items per transaction.
Leverage data analytics to identify customer buying patterns and preferences to tailor promotions effectively. For example, offering discounts on complementary products or items frequently purchased together can drive higher sales volume.

Shipping Optimization Strategies:
Consolidate orders or offer free shipping thresholds to encourage customers to increase their order sizes. Communicate these thresholds clearly to customers to incentivize them to add more items to their carts to qualify for free shipping.
Explore alternative shipping methods or partners to negotiate better rates or utilize more cost-effective shipping options, such as ground shipping over express delivery, where feasible.

Customer Engagement and Loyalty Programs:
Implement loyalty programs that reward customers for purchasing larger quantities or reaching certain spending thresholds. Offer perks such as exclusive discounts, early access to promotions, or free shipping for loyal customers to encourage repeat purchases and increase order sizes over time.
